- The unsnoozable alarm clock uses a radar sensor to detect if a person is lying on the bed.
- It rings the alarm when alarm clock reaches and the person is present.
- It would not stop until the person leave the bed.

- An improved version is that the pressure pad is added to detect if the person is lying, so the pressure pad is pressed.
- If the pressure pad is pressed or the person is deteted by the radar, the alarm would keep ringing.

### Instruction for users
- Set the time with the 3 buttons: set, up, and down. 'Set' button would change the the set mode from real time hour, real time minute, alarm time hour, alarm time minute, and alarm on or off.
- 
- The pressure pad is separated from the clock, it will detect the pressure on pressure pad and send the status pressed/releaesed to MQTT.
- 
- The pressure pad status can be get by the alarm clock and be a condition of the alarm.
- 
- The alarm clock and the pressure pad part are powered by 5v adaptors.
